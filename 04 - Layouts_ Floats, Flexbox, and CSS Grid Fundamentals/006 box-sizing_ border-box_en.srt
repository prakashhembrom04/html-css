1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,430
Let's now see how we can run into problems

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,653
with the default box model, and also how we can fix it.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,750
So what we're gonna do now is to finally fix the spacing

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,329
of this sidebar here a little bit.

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,190
So currently, there are no paddings, as you can see here,

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,680
and this is just a margin, but not a padding.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,280
So that's not really right,

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,120
so let's fix it and then we will run into a problem

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,930
and then we will solve it.

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,050
All right?

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,510
So we are actually done here with the code of the layout.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,543
So let's go to the aside that we have at the top,

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,020
because this code we will write now should actually apply

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,663
to all the layout methods.

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,320
So let's get rid of these comments here

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,470
and also of this width,

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,063
because we already have it defined by the end of the file.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,210
So let's give it a save.

19
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,600
And now actually the reason why there is some space here

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,858
is because right at the very beginning,

21
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:11,750
we added some margin here to the ul,

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,520
so to this unordered list,

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,330
because otherwise the bullet points disappeared.

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,890
Remember that.

25
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,460
But now we actually don't want that here.

26
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,100
So there should be no margin

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,563
because that just doesn't make no sense in that case.

28
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,422
So here we have that ul and that ol.

29
00:01:31,422 --> 00:01:35,100
And so here's the margin left of 50 that I just mentioned.

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,573
So let's see in our HTML, if this list here has some class.

31
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,060
Yeah, it does.

32
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,183
So it's the related class.

33
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,473
So let's copy that.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,543
And maybe it's already somewhere.

35
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah, here.

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,110
So related has a list style of none.

37
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,793
And let's say that it should have no margin.

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,890
Okay.

39
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,890
So in the ul selector, we have margin left set to something,

40
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,233
but we can override all the margins at the same time.

41
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,510
Left and set it to zero.

42
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,383
Okay. So that's better for now.

43
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,453
And so let's now go back and add some padding.

44
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,780
Right?

45
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,530
So when we want space inside of an element,

46
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,290
we should not use margin.

47
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,200
And so that's why we just remove it, but we still,

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,380
of course, want some space inside of this aside.

49
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,663
And so therefore we will want to add some padding.

50
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,780
So, let's say 40 pixels.

51
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,750
And now, as I saved this, watch what happens.

52
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,750
So I'm saving it now and now it suddenly disappeared.

53
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,393
So the whole site is gone.

54
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,250
So let's see what happened.

55
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,140
And the reason for that is

56
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,783
that now the elements became too big.

57
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,913
So let's inspect that.

58
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,950
And so

59
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,470
checking the site.

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,840
So we defined it at 300 pixels of width, right?

61
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,680
But then the padding of 40 pixels that we just added

62
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,870
gets added to the total width,

63
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,430
simply because that is the default behavior

64
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,990
of the box model.

65
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:31,160
And so now the total width of this element is 380,

66
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,393
which does no longer fit between the width of this article.

67
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,520
So the article is 825 pixels wide.

68
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,550
And if you watch closely up here in this corner,

69
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,060
as I now hover it,

70
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,260
you see that it is a bit wider

71
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,750
than there would have been space to fix the aside.

72
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,930
Right?

73
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,670
So, how do we fix this problem?

74
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,120
Should we now manually change the size of this aside here

75
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,380
in order to account for the padding?

76
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,113
Or is there maybe another way?

77
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,610
Well, indeed there is a better way.

78
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,210
And so now it's time to leave behind the default behavior

79
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,580
of the box model.

80
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,900
And so let's now quickly take a look

81
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,459
of how the other version of the box model works

82
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,713
and what it looks like.

83
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,610
And just to remember,

84
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,300
this is the default way of the box model

85
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,490
of calculating the elements widths and the heights.

86
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,100
So as we've seen in practice, many times,

87
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,320
whenever we specify a height or a width,

88
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,940
then the box model will add the border

89
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,850
and the padding on top of that.

90
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,537
And so that's exactly what created the situation

91
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:47,270
that we found ourselves in now on our page.

92
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,750
So in our layout, right?

93
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,240
So the sidebar grew too big because of the padding.

94
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,750
And so it no longer fit close to the article.

95
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,070
So wouldn't it be nice if we simply defined a certain height

96
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,700
or a certain width,

97
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,060
and then the element would simply be exactly that size,

98
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,190
no matter what border or padding?

99
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,980
Well, actually of course

100
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,540
we can do that simply by adding a little property

101
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,670
to the element, which is called box sizing.

102
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,960
And we set the value of that property to border-box.

103
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,310
So that's a nice and simple trick

104
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,400
that actually every single CSS developer uses.

105
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,770
So it would be completely impossible

106
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,510
to build large layouts

107
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,970
without using box sizing border box.

108
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,420
So again, the default way of the box model

109
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,110
actually doesn't make any sense at all.

110
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,250
So instead everyone simply adds box sizing,

111
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,560
border-box to all elements,

112
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,320
which will then forever fix the kind of problems

113
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,770
that we just experienced.

114
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,020
So as we can see in this new diagram

115
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,620
where box sizing has been set to border box,

116
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,330
now the specified width and height goes all the way

117
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,340
from one side of the border

118
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,530
to the opposite side of the border,

119
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,500
including of course the content area and the padding.

120
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,170
And so now the final width and height calculations

121
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,760
are very simple.

122
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,750
There's actually nothing left to calculate.

123
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,360
So the final width of any element will simply be

124
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,860
exactly the width that we define in our code,

125
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,460
no matter the padding and borders.

126
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,490
And the same of course goes for the height.

127
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,750
So if we now define some paddings or borders,

128
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,570
they will not get added to the dimensions of the box,

129
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,650
which really makes our lives so much easier.

130
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,310
Now, what this also means

131
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,470
at the same time is that padding and borders

132
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,300
that we do specify will not reduce the inner width

133
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,270
of the content area, but that's usually not a problem.

134
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,103
Okay.

135
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,520
And so now let's go back to our code

136
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,553
and actually apply this property.

137
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,950
Okay.

138
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,970
And so let's now do exactly what I showed you in the slide

139
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,970
and set box sizing to border box.

140
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,100
And by the way,

141
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,190
the default behavior is actually called content box.

142
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,290
Okay. But of course what we want is border box.

143
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,370
And so if we save this now again,

144
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,460
we should see that problem fixed.

145
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,483
And indeed.

146
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,483
Now it works.

147
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,703
So if we check out our box model, now,

148
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,110
of course the entire site,

149
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,970
then you'll see that the width of the content area

150
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,120
is no longer the 300 that we defined,

151
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,330
but instead the entire width of the element

152
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,730
is this 220 plus 40 plus this 40,

153
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,010
which if we add it all together,

154
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,980
that makes exactly 300 pixels,

155
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,340
which is the width that we defined

156
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,560
for this element right here.

157
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,500
Okay.

158
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,000
So that's exactly what I was saying by the end of the slide

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,450
I just showed you,

160
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,590
so that when we add some padding to an element,

161
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,623
then that will subtract from the content area.

162
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,393
Right?

163
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,530
And so again, the width of the content area is now only 220,

164
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,790
but that's not a problem at all

165
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,100
because what we're really interested in

166
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,280
is the width of the entire element itself.

167
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,373
And so that is now exactly the 300

168
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:38,663
that we specified,

169
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,560
because otherwise, let's just toggle it off one more time.

170
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,033
Then you'll see down here

171
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:48,990
that we are back to having the 300 applied

172
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,360
to the content area

173
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,593
and then 40 on each side on top of that.

174
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,760
So that's not what we want

175
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,263
and so here we fix that.

176
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,183
Nice.

177
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,630
Now we always want the box model to work like this

178
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,550
by default on every single element from here on.

179
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,520
And so basically what we want is for this property here

180
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,560
to be applied to every single element on the page.

181
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,890
So how can we do that?

182
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,110
Well, I will cut it from here

183
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,110
and then I will put it here in the universal selector.

184
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,610
Okay.

185
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,110
And I'm not putting it here in the body

186
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,100
because box sizing is not one of these properties

187
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,960
that gets inherited,

188
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,800
so we can't put it on the body selector,

189
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,640
but instead on the universal selector.

190
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,730
And so now along with margin and padding,

191
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,530
this box sizing border box gets applied

192
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,033
to every single element.

193
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,773
So I'll give it a save and it still works.

194
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,500
So something like this here is

195
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,060
what most developers actually add to their CSS.

196
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,890
So a simple global reset like this,

197
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,790
and then basically enabling this better behavior

198
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,360
of the box model on every single element.

199
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,510
Okay.

200
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,650
With that we're actually done.

201
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,600
I'm just quickly going to add some margin here to the bottom

202
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,240
of this h4,

203
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,393
since we are talking about fixing spacing.

204
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,633
Margin-bottom, let's say 20 pixels,

205
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,263
or let's make it a bit more and say 30 pixels.

206
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,490
Great. So you just learned one more very important thing

207
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,350
on your journey of becoming a CSS developer.

208
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,240
So what I just showed you again,

209
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,740
is something that every single CSS developer does and uses.

210
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,510
And so it was really important

211
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,010
that you learned about this important trick.

212
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,700
And it's also important

213
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,180
that you really understand how it works.

214
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,330
So make sure that you maybe review that slide

215
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,280
that I showed you and review the code that we wrote here,

216
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,740
and then you are ready for yet another coding challenge.

217
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,193
So hopefully I see you there very soon.
