1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,910
So to wrap up this section,

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,803
here is coding challenge number three.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,397
And I hope you're not yet tired of this example

4
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:15,393
because we will work with it one more time here.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,980
So in the last challenge,

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,530
you built this layout here using flexbox.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,360
And so as you might've guessed,

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,360
now it's time to build the exact same layout using CSS Grid.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,200
Okay.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,920
Now, when we built this with flexbox,

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,510
we wrapped these three columns here,

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,390
so these three elements into one container element,

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,520
and we then used flexbox only on that.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,560
So a little bit, like we also did in our block post project,

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,010
right, but now I actually want you to go ahead

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,010
and remove that container div and basically use all of this,

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,510
so the entire element here, as the flex container.

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,780
Okay.

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,450
Now, another important hint that I need to give you

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,600
as you start designing your grid,

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,970
is that this here is going to be the first column.

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,170
So this image, right?

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,290
And so remember that this one here has a fixed width

24
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,950
of 250 pixels, and so probably you should adjust

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,320
your column to that.

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,290
Okay.

27
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,370
So just keep that in mind and yeah,

28
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,970
that's actually all you need to do for this challenge.

29
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,810
So the minor stuff that we did before with flexbox,

30
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,320
and what I mean is this here, and the colors,

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,450
so that I want you to leave intact.

32
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,410
So keep using flexbox for that and use CSS Grid only

33
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,966
for the over layout here,

34
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:47,741
which is actually two dimensional.

35
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:52,490
And so CSS grid is a good fit for that.

36
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,300
So as always, take all the time that you need,

37
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,313
and then meet me back here once you are done.

38
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,530
All right, and I am 100% sure that was fun for you.

39
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,490
So, as I said, let's start by removing this container here

40
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,223
together with its closing tag, of course.

41
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,570
Then let's go up here and remove all the traces of flexbox

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,260
in this layout.

43
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,780
And actually let's also get rid

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,563
of this stupid, clear fix class.

45
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,660
So here we have our container,

46
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,030
which right now is set to display flex.

47
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,030
So let's change that to display grid like this.

48
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,693
And then we also need to specify, of course, our columns.

49
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,053
So grid, template,

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,980
columns.

51
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,710
And then remember what I said about our first column.

52
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,690
So the first column we want this image here to be,

53
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,830
which has a width of 250.

54
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,670
So it's basically a fixed width that we want to maintain,

55
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,670
and so let's make our first column also exactly 250 pixels.

56
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,860
And then the other two columns,

57
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,550
we want them both to occupy at the exact same space

58
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,500
and they should also fill up all the remaining space.

59
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,500
And so therefore, we give both of them the width of one FR.

60
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,143
And so with this, let's wait for it.

61
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,900
Well, that didn't really do anything.

62
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,100
Oh, and of course,

63
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,290
because we just removed the container class.

64
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,563
and so this code should actually be on the product itself.

65
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,010
So where is that?

66
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,223
Ah, yeah, right here.

67
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,490
So let's see, ah, beautiful.

68
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,513
That looks a lot better.

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,091
Well, it's far from being perfect, but it's something.

70
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,690
Right?

71
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,720
So let's get rid of this container code,

72
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,380
which made us do this small mistake.

73
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,000
And now let's think about this title here

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,660
and also about the button,

75
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,930
which are not one of these three columns.

76
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,140
Right?

77
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,530
So what we want to happen to them is that they should

78
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,937
stretch all the way from the start to the end, right?

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,770
So the title is exactly this one, so product title.

80
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,567
And so here we say grid column one,

81
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,123
two minus one.

82
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,400
So that's a trick that hopefully, you know by now.

83
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,350
And so let's actually copy it and use the same thing

84
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,503
on the button.

85
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,423
So this one should do the exact same thing, right?

86
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,280
So button, let's add that there

87
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,663
and beautiful.

88
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,490
Now here, we still have some gaps that we do not want

89
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,510
and that's because we simply maintained

90
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,330
the get property that we had before from flexbox.

91
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,187
But instead it is now column gap and actually,

92
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,820
we're already done.

93
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,150
So that was a bit too easy, maybe.

94
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,870
So basically the main trick here

95
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,000
in order to remain this width was simply

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,570
to give this column the exact same size as the image,

97
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,380
so as we already had done before here.

98
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,220
And then everything else simply happened automatically.

99
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,220
So this row here basically also has the height of 250 pixels

100
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,730
because that is the height of the biggest content here.

101
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,763
So this image,

102
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,850
right?

103
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,530
And just to quickly inspect that.

104
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,870
So I always like to use this grid overlay

105
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,343
because it makes it so clear what exactly is happening.

106
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,760
And so again, we can see here that this entire row,

107
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,313
so all the elements here do have a width of,

108
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:17,480
or actually a height, of 250 and this one does not,

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,930
but that's simply because there is not enough content

110
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,280
in there.

111
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,930
But anyway, with this,

112
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,400
we actually now finished the topic of CSS Grid

113
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,140
and also this entire big section

114
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,310
on building layouts with CSS.

115
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,090
So this was quite a fundamental and important section

116
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,670
that sets the stage for the rest of the course.

117
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,590
And so I should warn you once again, that,

118
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,660
in order to advance to the rest of the course now,

119
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,100
you should make sure that you really understand

120
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,280
this material quite well.

121
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,990
So it doesn't need to be perfect.

122
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,090
You don't need to know all the properties by heart,

123
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,860
again, but you should at least understand

124
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,750
how these technologies that we learned work

125
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,920
and a little bit about how you can use them.

126
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,170
So take all the time that you need in order to practice

127
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,930
as much as you can,

128
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,690
and only then let's move on together to our next section,

129
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,630
which is actually one of the most exciting one,

130
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,030
I think, at least in this entire course.

131
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,130
So we're going to talk about web design

132
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,740
and learn a lot of different rules and guidelines

133
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,860
and we will actually also apply them immediately

134
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,090
to a new project.

135
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,070
So it's time to say goodbye to our block post project here

136
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,570
because in the next section,

137
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,980
we will start a new one.

138
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,690
But anyway, enough talk and I see you soon

139
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,453
in that next section.
