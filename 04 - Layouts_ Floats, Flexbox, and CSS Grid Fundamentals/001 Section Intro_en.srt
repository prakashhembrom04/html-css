(typing)

2
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:07,939
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,890
All right, welcome back to the next section

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,343
where we will now take your CSS skills to the next level.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,950
So up until this point, we have used CSS

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,460
to add visual styles and spacing to elements.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,460
However, CSS can be used for much more than just that.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,400
And in fact, one of the main applications

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,120
of CSS is to build layouts.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,370
And so that's what we're gonna do next.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,550
So in this section, you will learn

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,410
how to build layouts using floats

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,770
and also using two really modern technologies,

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,930
which are called flexbox and CSS Grid.

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,010
And in fact, this is gonna be

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,040
one of the most important sections of this course.

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,810
And so really make sure to take all the time

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,010
that you need to understand it.

19
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,440
That's really important, but anyway,

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,063
let's get back to work right away.
